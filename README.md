Sorry for being a day late as I was in hospital over the Easter break. I did speak to Daniel (Instructor) and Amy (TA) to let them know of my situation
I added my observations in a separate file called Observations.txt
Some of my graphs are not the prettiest in that they could have better colors, labels and axes. But I was in a rush to hand my homework in.
