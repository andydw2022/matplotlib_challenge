Sorry for being a day late as I was in hospital over the Easter break. I did speak to Daniel (Instructor) and Amy (TA) to let them know of my situation.
I added my observations in a separate file called Observations.txt.
Some of my graphs are not the prettiest in that they could have better colors, labels and axes. But I was in a rush to hand my homework in.
Also there is a lot of code I commented out but I left them in there so markers could see what I was trying to do and experiment with. 
Looks crowded and confusing. Sorry about that. If I had been able to spend more time on it over Easter I am sure I would have some up with a better submission
