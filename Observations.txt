Observations on the mouse study
----------------------------------

1. The Standard Error of the mean of the data for the various drugs suggests that Ramicane has the smallest SEM whereas Ketapril has the higest SEM

2. The drugs were not tested on equal number of mice (sample sizes) which may reflect on the efficacy if the drugs on tumour size.

	     
Drug Regimen  Drug Count
------------  -----------	 
Capomulin	230
Ceftamin	178
Infubinol	178
Ketapril	188
Naftisol	186
Placebo	        181
Propriva	156
Ramicane	228
Stelasyn	181
Zoniferol	182

3. Looking at the results of final tumour sizes of the four drugs 
 Capomulin,
 Ramicane, 
 Infubinol,
 Ceftamin

Ceftamin seemed to have the largest increase in final tumour size whereas Ramicane has the smallest. This may imply Ramicane is
the more effective of the drugs on tumour sizes.

4. The box plot is interesting in that no discerbible outliers could be seen in the plot and the whiskers are about even and the IQR
which could indicate that the data is evenly spread and hence close to a normal distribution.
The median is not quite in the middle of the box

5. There seems to be low correlation between mouse weight and tumour size (0.59)

6. Linear regression within the scatter plot should not be relied on for extrapoation.
